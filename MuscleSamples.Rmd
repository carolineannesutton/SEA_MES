## Match data to tubes
```{r}
cc <- cc %>% 
  select(SPCODE,SCIENTIFIC_NAME,COMMON_NAME) %>%
  distinct()

tissues_all <- tissues_all %>%

```

### Priority samples
```{r}
sites_P <- sites_P %>% 
  mutate(choose = "y")

Tissues_priority <- tissues_all %>% 
  # choose priority sites
  left_join(sites_P, by = "SITE_ID") %>% 
  filter(choose == "y") %>% 
  # choose priority spcecies
  filter(SPCODE == 37296001 | SPCODE == 37445006 | SPCODE == 37439002 | SPCODE == 37038004 | SPCODE == 37287001 | SPCODE == 37228002| SPCODE == 37465006| SPCODE == 37330014| SPCODE == 37227001)

# check selection
#distinct(Tissues_priority,COMMON_NAME)
```

### Tube samples
```{r}

#add scientific name
tubes <- tubes %>%
  left_join(tissues_all, by = "TISSUE") %>% 
  arrange(Tube_no) 

# add size catagory
tubes<- tubes %>% 
  mutate(Species_size = ifelse(SPCODE == 37296001 & LENGTH_MM >=300, "Platycephalus richardsoni_lg",SCIENTIFIC_NAME)) %>% 
    mutate(Species_size = ifelse(Species_size == 'Platycephalus richardsoni', "Platycephalus richardsoni_sm",Species_size)) 

write.csv(tubes,"results/SEAMES_IN2023V05_isotopetubes.csv")

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
